Here is the list of metrics used in deep learning.
1. True Positive Rate (TPR) - classification.
2. True Negative Rate (TNR) - classification
3. False Positive Rate (FPR) - classification
4. False Negative Rate (FNR) - classification
5. Accuracy - classification
6. Precision - classification
7. Recall - classification
8. F1 Score - classification
9. AUC ROC CURVE - classification
10. Confusion Matrix - classification

Here we'll define these one by one in detail.

1. True Positive:
    Model correctly predicts the Positive class.

2. True Negative:
    Model correctly predicts the Negative class.

3. False Positive:
    Model incorrectly predicts the Positive class.

4. False Negative:
    Model incorrectly predicts the Negative class.

5. Accuracy:
    Accuracy is used to measure the performance of a classification Model.
    Accuracy = Number of correct predictions / Total number of predictions.
    Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN).
    Accuracy alone doesn't tell the full story when you're working with a 
    class-imbalanced data set, like this one, where there is a significant 
    disparity between the number of positive and negative labels.

6. Precision:
    Precision is used to measure the performance of a classification Model.
    What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?
    Precision = Number of correct positive predictions / Number of positive predictions.
    Precision = TP / (TP + FP).
    
7. Recall:
    Recall is used to measure the performance of a classification Model.
    What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?
    Samples was actually positive and how many were identified correctly?
    Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

    To fully evaluate the effectiveness of a model, you must examine both precision and recall.

8. ROC Curve and AUC:
    Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the
    performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. this
    curve plots two parameters, True positive rate and False positive rate.

    True Positive Rate (TPR) = TP / (TP + FN)
    False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP / (FP + TN)

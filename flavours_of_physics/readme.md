# Flavours of Physics: Finding τ → μμμ: Identify a rare decay phenomenon

Link: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/flavours-of-physics>

## Purpose of the Project

In this project, we need to find a new phenomena called, charged lepton falvour violation.

 In the Standard Model, lepton flavour, the number of electrons and electron-neutrinos, muons and muon-neutrinos, and tau and tau-neutrinos, is one such conserved quantity, just like conservation of energy, linear momentum and angular momentum in classical physics.

Interestingly, in many proposed extensions to the Standard Model, this symmetry doesn’t exist, implying decays that do not conserve lepton flavour are possible. One decay searched for at the LHC is τ → μμμ (or τ → 3μ). Observation of this decay would be a clear indication of the violation of lepton flavour and a sign of long-sought new physics.

## Dataset Description

In this competition, you are given a list of collision events and their properties. You will then predict whether a τ → 3μ decay happened in this collision. This τ → 3μ is currently assumed by scientists not to happen, and the goal of this competition is to discover τ → 3μ happening more frequently than scientists currently can understand.

### training.csv

This is a labelled dataset (the label ‘signal’ being ‘1’ for signal events, ‘0’ for background events) to train the classifier. Signal events have been simulated, while background events are real data.
